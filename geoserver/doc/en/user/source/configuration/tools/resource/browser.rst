Before you start
----------------

The resource browser is used to manage configuration resources in environments that do not provide direct disk access:

* When running GeoServer on a remote machine it can be difficult mange the icons and fonts used for effective styling
* Some cloud deployments of GeoServer operate without a data directory. In these environments the resource browser is used to manage items stored in a database or cloud storage rather than a file system.
* Folders are visual only, when creating or uploading a resource you can type a path and folders will be created as needed.

.. warning::
   
   Please use this tool with caution:

   * Configuration files managed by the web administration application can be reviewed and even modified using this tool.
   * It is not advised to edit these files directly as GeoServer must reload its Catalog to notice these changes.
